title: "About me"
---

I've always been interested in mathematics, physics, and technology which is able to describe our world.

I enjoy programming primarily in Python, but I also dabble in some Lua, Rust, C, and C++.

Appart from programming I genuinely enjoy learning new things, biking, and going for a nice refreshing hike.
