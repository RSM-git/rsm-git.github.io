# Word Clouds
To examine the textual differences of the two publication, we chose to look at word clouds and sentiment. The word clouds are generated by removing stop words and punctuation and calculating the tf-idf for each word. For the sentiment analysis, we used a BERT transformer model from the Huggingface library. See the explainer notebook for more information.

In order to get a crude overview of the topics covered by each publication, we generated a word cloud for each of them.



We are interested in examining how the two publications portray the same subject. Here, we will use the sections to look for general tendencies in their reporting.
First, we need to determine which sections are concerned with the same subjects which we will do by looking at the word clouds generated by using tf-idf on the different sections.


|               Reuters               |               NYT               |
|:----------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| ![](/images/Reuters_Section-Politics.png) | ![](/images/NYT_Section-us.png) |
| ![](/images/Reuters_Section-World-News.png) | ![](/images/NYT_Section-world.png) |

Clearly, both Reuters' politics section and the NYT's us section has an emphasis on the 2016 United States presidential election which is a great topic for comparison as US politics is a highly polarizing topic.

Let's plot these word clouds in a higher resolution

![](/images/NYT_Section-us.png)

Comparing the word clouds for the Reuters Politics section and the NYT us section, we see that most words are the same including the predominant ones such as Trump, The White House, and democrat/republican. 
Some of the differences are the NYT having Sanders, referring to the very left leaning senator Bernie Sanders while Reuters have wall and Mexico, referring to Trump's promise of building a wall on the boarder of Mexico.
Although it's impossible to draw any significant conclusions on these differences, on possible interpretation is that the NYT focusses more on the politics and politicians of the Democratic party while Reuters focuses more on the major talking points of the compaigns.

# Sentiment Analysis
We used sentiment analysis on all the articles for each publication to look for some general trends in each publication.
The table below shows how many articles was classified with a given sentiment for each publication
|                                     |               Reuters               |               NYT               |
|:----------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
|Negative | 46,478 (83%) | 16,995 (70%)|
|Neutral | 5,759 (10%)| 3,821 (16%)|
|Positive | 3,809 (7%)| 3,561 (14%)|

Clearly, both publications share the same trend of the vast majority of articles having a negative sentiment. However, Reuters take the lead in being the most negative with 83% of their articles being negative and only 7% being positive. Percentwise, the NYT has twice as many positive but still pretty low a 14%.
While these results were unexpected, it is perhaps not that surprising as it is a well known phenomenon that [the average person is drawn to negative news](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140728-why-is-all-the-news-bad) and publications print what sells.

We thought it interesting to look at if the negative sentiment is caused by a few high-throughput authors or if most authors write with this sentiment.
We therefore found all the articles that each author wrote in the dataset and determined the most frequent sentiment of each author. In this was, we can classify each author as majorily writing in a negative, neutral, or positive sentiment.
The bar plots below show these findings

From the plots it is evident that the vast majority of authors write in a negative sentiment but that it is even more common at the NYT than at Reuters.
