We chose to work with articles from the two publications with the most articles in the dataset: Reuters with 840,094 articles, and The New York Times (NYT) with 252,259 authors.
The dataset contains 10 features: authors, title, article text, url, section, publication and four features describing the time of publication.</description></item><item><title>Network analysis</title><link>https://rsm-git.github.io/network-analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rsm-git.github.io/network-analysis/</guid><description>We construct the network based on the co-authorship of articles, to examine the collaborations of the news agencies. We construct a graph where each node represents an author and each edge represents a co-authorship between two authors. The network is undirected and unweighted. The size of the nodes are scaled based on the number of articles the author has written. We create a graph for both Reuters and The New York Times.</description></item><item><title>Text analysis</title><link>https://rsm-git.github.io/text-analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rsm-git.github.io/text-analysis/</guid><description>We are interested in examining how the two publications portray the same subject. Here, we will use the sections to look for general tendencies in their reporting. First, we need to determine which sections are concerned with the same subjects which we will do by looking at the word clouds generated by using tf-idf on the different sections.
